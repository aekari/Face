## Description

When the user hovers over the character with their mouse:
1. The background and character colors invert
2. His eyes and mouth change shape

If you are curious how I accomplished this, please look the .pde file as I have commented every line of code explaining what everything means.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org)
2. Download this repository to your local computer
3. Open the .pde file in Processing and run the sketch
4. Hover over the face to "wake up" the character ðŸ˜´â†’ðŸ˜²
